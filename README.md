JINQ
====

Jinq - Javascript Intergrated Query Language Extensions.
The library works with plain old javascript. No need for jQuery etc. 

The project is still heavily work in progress, so far the following methods have been implemented:
contains: 100%
distinct: 100%

The following are expected to be created soon:
first - returns the first non null value
last - returns the last none null value
allByType - gets all values by a type name e.g. "number"
reverse - reverses the array
where - returns based on comparison criteria
count - counts in different ways e.g. by value
each - as in for each but uses each object rather than index
random - randomises the order of the array
swap - for swapping out on matching value
index - gets the index of first instance
indexes - gets all indexes of matching value
grow - increses size of array
shrink - shrinks size of array
